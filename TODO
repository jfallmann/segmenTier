* segment_test and segment_data: cluster sequence for segmentClusters
0- or 1-based?

* segmentCluster vs. segmentCluster.batch aligned in usage?

* low.thresh vs. nui.thresh

* proper nuissance cluster: set multi and multib properly to get
segment breaks ?

* check backtrace

* NOTE: after reimplementation w/o scoring functin matrices - why is left 
part of test data not separated well anymore at M=175?

-> find a way to reflect total score!
