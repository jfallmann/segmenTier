* convert varySettings to matrix params; and allow combine=FALSE

* test scoring function with j<=i; segment_test/data, runSegmentier testsets

* check initialization

* implement alternative nuissance cluster

* segmentCluster vs. segmentCluster.batch aligned in usage?

* proper nuissance cluster: set multi and multib properly to get
segment breaks ?

* check backtrace

* test current dc1 scaling to account for total score in clustering

* consensus segments!
