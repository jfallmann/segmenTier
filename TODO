* segment_test and segment_data: cluster sequence for segmentClusters
0- or 1-based?

* segmentCluster vs. segmentCluster.batch aligned in usage?

* proper nuissance cluster: set multi and multib properly to get
segment breaks ?

* check backtrace

* test current dc1 scaling to account for total score in clustering

* consensus segments!
