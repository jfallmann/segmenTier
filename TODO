* convert varySettings to matrix params; and allow combine=FALSE

* implement Appendix A for cluster-free segmentation

* consensus segments over multiple clusterings with the same K!

* analyze re-clustering by segmentation, e.g. silhouettes, BIC, etc.

* allow to use a global clustering, i.e., provide an interface
that takes cluster centers and calculates icor/ccor matrices
for local data

* write a proper vignette and re-check all documentation
