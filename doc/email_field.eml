Hi Rainer,

Sorry for the late reply! For licensing requests like this, we hold a
monthly standing meeting to determine next steps, permissions, and fees
where necessary.

We're happy to report that the unanimous consensus is that you can use this
photo for free with the following credit line: (c) Field Museum

Hope this is helpful,
Angelica
