\description{
provides a log-likelihood method for \code{\link[stats:kmeans]{kmeans}}
results, after Neal Fultz at \url{https://stackoverflow.com/a/33202188},
also featured in the
\href{https://rdrr.io/github/nfultz/stackoverflow/src/R/logLik_kmeans.R}{stackoverflow package}. Note that the blogged version on Jan 30, 2019 add a minus
and a division by 2 compared to the package version.
The strategy has not been reviewed, and this function has not been
tested extensively; feel free to do so and contribute your results. 
This is an attempt to reproduce the \code{BIC} measure
in model-based clustering to decide on an optimal number of clusters.
This function will be used for \code{\link[stats:kmeans]{kmeans}}
results objects when passed to \code{\link[stats:BIC]{BIC}} and
\code{\link[stats:AIC]{AIC}} functions from the \pkg{stats} package in
base R, and is used in this manner in \code{\link{segmentClusters}}.
