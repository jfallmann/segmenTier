`segmenTier` is a dynamic programming solution to segmentation based
on maximization of arbitrary similarity measures within segments
[@Machne2017]. In addition to the core algorithm, this package
provides time-series processing and clustering functions as described
in the publication. These are generally applicable where a `kmeans`
clustering yields meaningful results, and have been specifically
developed for clustering of the Discrete Fourier Transform of periodic
gene expression data ("circadian" or "yeast metabolic
oscillations"). This clustering approach is outlined in the
supplemental material of [@Machne2012], and here is used as a basis of
segment similarity measures.

# Theory

`segmenTier`'s input is a clustering
$\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}\subseteq\mathbb{X}$, $\alpha=1,\dots N$.
`segmenTier` then solves the recursion:

\begin{equation}
  S_{k,\alpha} =
  \max_{j\le k} \max_{\beta\ne\alpha}
                 S_{j-1,\beta} + s(j,k,\alpha) - M\;,
\label{eq:01}
\end{equation}

where $s(j,k,\alpha)$ is a scoring function that provides similarity of a segment
from position $j$ to $k$ to clusters $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$, *e.g.* based on Pearson correlation
to cluster centers, and $M$ is a penalty incurred
by the use of a new segment, a fixed cost for each jump that allows to 
fine-tune minimal segment lengths. Backtracing the maximal scores $S(k,\alpha)$ then
provides both segment borders and segment cluster association.

Clustering tools are provided in the package, and a full pipeline is
available for clustering the Fourier-transform of oscillatory RNA-seq time-series,
("circadian or metabolic oscillations"). See **Quick Guide**.
 

The theory behind the package is detailed in @Machne2017. 

# Usage

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("segmenTier")
```

The development version can be obtained from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("raim/segmenTier", subdir = "pkg")
```



## Quick Guide

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
library(segmenTier)

data(primseg436) # RNA-seq time-series data

# fourier-transform and cluster timeseries:
tset <- processTimeseries(ts=tsd, dft.range=1:7, dc.trafo="ash")
cset <- clusterTimeseries(tset)
# ... segment it:
segments <- segmentClusters(seq=cset, M=100, E=2, nui=3, S="icor")
# and inspect results:
plotSegmentation(tset,cset,segments)
```



Usage of the package is further demonstrated in two R demos.

## Demo I: Direct Interface to Algorithm

The main low level interface to the algorithm, function `segmentClusters`,
is demonstrated in the file `demo/segment_test.R`. 
It produces Supplemental Figure S1 of the preprint 
manuscript.

To run it as a demo in R simply type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
demo("segment_test", package = "segmenTier")
```

## Demo II: Time-Series Clustering & Batch Segmentation 

A real-life data set is processed, clustered and 
segmented with varying parameters in 
`demo/segment_data.R`.

This demo runs quite long, since it calculates many 
segmentations. It produces Figure 3 and Supplemental Figures
S4a and S4b of [@Machne2017].

```{r, eval=FALSE}
demo("segment_data", package = "segmenTier")
```
