        abstract = {The segmentation of time series and genomic data is a common problem
in computational biology. With increasingly complex measurement
procedures individual data points are often not just numbers or
simple vectors in which all  components are of the same kind.
Analysis methods that capitalize on slopes in a  single real-valued
data track or that make explicit use of the vectorial nature of
the data are not applicable in such scenaria. We develop here
a framework for  segmentation in arbitrary data domains that only
requires a minimal notion of similarity. Using unsupervised clustering
of (a sample of) the input yields an approximate segmentation
algorithm that is efficient enough for genome-wide applications.
As a showcase application we segment a time-series of transcriptome
sequencing data from budding yeast, in high temporal resolution
over ca. 2.5 cycles of the short-period respiratory oscillation.
The algorithm is used with a  similarity measure focussing on
periodic expression profiles across the metabolic cycle rather
than coverage per time point.}

        abstract = {When grown in continuous culture, budding yeast cells tend to
synchronize their respiratory activity to form a stable oscillation
that percolates throughout cellular physiology and involves the
majority of the protein-coding transcriptome. Oscillations in
batch culture and at single cell level support the idea that these
dynamics constitute a general growth principle. The precise molecular
mechanisms and biological functions of the oscillation remain
elusive.  Fourier analysis of transcriptome time series datasets
from two different oscillation periods (0.7 h and 5 h) reveals
seven distinct co-expression clusters common to both systems (34\%
of all yeast ORF), which consolidate into two superclusters when
correlated with a compilation of 1,327 unrelated transcriptome
datasets. These superclusters encode for cell growth and anabolism
during the phase of high, and mitochondrial growth, catabolism
and stress response during the phase of low oxygen uptake. The
promoters of each cluster are characterized by different nucleotide
contents, promoter nucleosome configurations, and dependence on
ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. We show that the
ATP:ADP ratio oscillates, compatible with alternating metabolic
activity of the two superclusters and differential feedback on
their transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive (Isw2)
types of promoter structure remodeling. We propose a  novel feedback
mechanism, where the energetic state of the cell, reflected in
the ATP:ADP ratio, gates the transcription of large, but functionally
coherent groups of genes via differential effects of ATP-dependent
nucleosome remodeling machineries. Besides providing a mechanistic
hypothesis for the delayed negative  feedback that results in
the oscillatory phenotype, this mechanism may underpin the continuous
adaptation of growth to environmental conditions.}
