        abstract = {The segmentation of time series and genomic data is a common problem
in computational biology. With increasingly complex measurement
procedures individual data points are often not just numbers or
simple vectors in which all  components are of the same kind.
Analysis methods that capitalize on slopes in a  single real-valued
data track or that make explicit use of the vectorial nature of
the data are not applicable in such scenaria. We develop here
a framework for  segmentation in arbitrary data domains that only
requires a minimal notion of similarity. Using unsupervised clustering
of (a sample of) the input yields an approximate segmentation
algorithm that is efficient enough for genome-wide applications.
As a showcase application we segment a time-series of transcriptome
sequencing data from budding yeast, in high temporal resolution
over ca. 2.5 cycles of the short-period respiratory oscillation.
The algorithm is used with a  similarity measure focussing on
periodic expression profiles across the metabolic cycle rather
than coverage per time point.}
